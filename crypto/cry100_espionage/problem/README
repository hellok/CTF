We suspect an employee of one of the embassies has leaked confidential information to a foreign intelligence agency. We've managed to capture an individual whom we assume to be the recipient of the info. Our forensics department has managed to recover two messages from his outbox, which appear to be encrypted using some crypto tool. Along with each email our suspect also received an SMS message containing a password, however we were only able to recover one - "SieR1mephad7oose".

Could you help us decrypt both messages?
