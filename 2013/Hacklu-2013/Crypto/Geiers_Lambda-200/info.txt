Geier's Lambda (Category: Crypto) Author(s): asante
Hey!
We need your help. Our agent found some details about a huge conspiracy. Looks
like they wanna plant a bomb near the Oktoberfest's main fairground ride. But
we have a good chance, to get the defusing-password. That's where you have to
jump in. We managed to steal the encrypted password along with a decryption
file. Our agent also started to work on it, but one of the robots caught him
and now we are left-behind with his infos.

He found a collision on the real password but wasn't sure, if he can use that
one. But, here is it: “Le1sRI6I” - perhaps you have better luck. He also found
out, that the robots only use alphanumeric characters and that the collision
is of the same length, than the real password. The last thing he told us is,
that the defusing password must contain only printable characters.

Hope that helps you! And now hurry!

Here is your challenge:
