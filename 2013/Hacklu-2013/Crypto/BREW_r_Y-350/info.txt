Finally, the robots managed to sneak into one of our breweries. I guess I
won't have to explain how bad that really is. That darn non-physical ones even
shutdown our login system. Shiny thing, advanced technology, all based on
fingerprints. Been secure as hell. If only it was running. Well, basically,
we're screwed.
But wait, there's hope. Seems like they didn't shutdown our old login system.
Backward compatibility's a bitch, eh? Unfortunately, we got like zero
knowledge about the system. I mean come on, the last time we used that thingy
was like decades ago. If we are lucky, the old authentication method is buggy.
So, I heard you're kinda smart? Have a look at it. We desperately need to get
drunk^W supply. You'll find the old system at ctf.fluxfingers.net:1335. Good
luck.
