We have discovered a robo-server using some strange key agreement. Looks like
they combine two different ones. You have to figure out what they expect,
connect to their service and get the password. It's absolutly urgent, we need
it to shut down the robo-factory on our way to the Oktoberfest - otherwise we
can not dare to get our Bavarian beers.

Oh btw, the robots use AES-ECB for symmetric encryption.
