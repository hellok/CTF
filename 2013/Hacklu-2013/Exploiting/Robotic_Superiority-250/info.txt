Robotic Superiority (Category: Exploiting) Author(s): lama
Help us fight the evil robotic lieutenant Don Sim. He wants to spread robo
propaganda to cover his actions on the Oktoberfest. But he needs good video
footage for that. So he created an IRC bot that collects information about
robots in movies. Robotic emancipation can NOT happen, you have to stop him!
All we need is his private key. Our agents located the bot, here is all we
know about it:

Server: irc://ctf.fluxfingers.net:1313 
Bot: lib[1-5] (load balancer) 
Key: /var/private/key.txt 

Hint: All available commands are listed with "help". 3 connections allowed per
ip.
