Wannabe (Category: Exploiting) Author(s): r1cky
One of our informants met a guy who calls himself Elite Arthur, he is a real
jackass, and he thinks he is the best hacker alive. We got reason to believe
that the robots hired him to write the firmwares for their weapons. But to
write such a firmware we need the key to sign the code. Luckily for us, our
informant also found his website: â€¦. your job is to hack the server, find the
flag and show this little cocksucker how skilled he really is. We count on
you.
