typedef struct _llist {
   struct _llist *next;
   uint32_t tag;
   char data[100];
 llist;
 
and:
 
register char *answer;
char *(*func)();
llist *head;
...
func = (char *(*)(llist *))userBuf;
answer = (char *)(*func)(head);
send_string(answer);
exit(0);
 
Write me shellcode that traverses the randomly generated linked list, looking for a node with a tag 0x41414100, and returns a pointer to the data associated with that tag, such that the call to send_string will output the answer.
